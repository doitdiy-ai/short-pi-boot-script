# ~/.nanorc
# Settings for nano
# These settings override the global settings in /etc/nanorc
# The settings are in turn overridden by command-line options,
# so as we have defined nano as an alias to nano -iFmzAc, we
# have expressed a preference for:
#   i - auto-indent
#   F - enable multiple file buffers (more than one open file)
#   m - mouse support: mouseclick can move cursor and execute shortcuts
#   z - enable suspend ability
#   A - smart Home key (jumps to start of text)
#   c - constantly show cursor position in status bar
# Colors: [foreground,background] white, black, blue, green, red, cyan, yellow, magenta,
# and normal -- where normal  means the  default  foreground or background color. 
# The name of the foreground color may be prefixed with bright (â‰ˆ bold)
